# Implementation Plan: Desktop Vocabulary Learning MVP

**Branch**: `002-desktop-vocab-learning` | **Date**: 2026-03-20 | **Spec**: [`specs/002-desktop-vocab-learning/spec.md`](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/002-desktop-vocab-learning/spec.md`

## Summary

Build a desktop-first, offline vocabulary learning application with Tauri v2. Use Rust for native capabilities, DSL parsing, and local SQLite-backed storage; use React + TypeScript for the UI; keep study state and imported dictionary content local to the device; and organize frontend state with small domain-focused Zustand stores while using Semantic UI React and styled-components for rapid MVP interface delivery.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Rust stable for the Tauri backend, TypeScript 5.x for the React frontend
**Primary Dependencies**: Tauri v2, React, Zustand, styled-components, Semantic UI React, `@tauri-apps/plugin-sql` with SQLite support
**Storage**: SQLite for application data plus app-owned local file storage for imported DSL source files when users choose to retain originals
**Testing**: Rust unit tests for parser, migrations, and search services; Vitest + React Testing Library for UI and store behavior; documented manual smoke checks for startup, import, offline use, and persistence
**Target Platform**: Desktop application for macOS, Windows, and Linux
**Project Type**: Desktop app
**Performance Goals**: 95% of searches return results or an explicit no-results state within 1 second; review interactions feel immediate; importing large dictionaries does not freeze the UI thread
**Constraints**: Fully offline for MVP flows, local-data-safe, keyboard and mouse friendly, able to handle multiple dictionaries and hundreds of thousands of entries, minimal background processing, no cloud dependency
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user desktop app, multiple imported dictionaries, thousands of saved cards, and enough local content volume to support serious vocabulary study

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Pre-Research Gate Review

- **Desktop-First Experience**: PASS. The plan uses a native desktop shell, keyboard- and mouse-friendly flows, and a windowed interface with primary actions visible in-app.
- **Local Data Safety**: PASS. Imported content, cards, collections, and review state are stored in application-owned local storage. Destructive actions will require explicit user confirmation.
- **Stable Offline Behavior**: PASS. Search, card creation, collection management, and review all run against local SQLite data with no network dependency.
- **Basic Quality Gates**: PASS. The implementation plan includes automated verification for parser, data, and UI logic plus manual smoke checks for startup and persistence.
- **Keep It Simple**: PASS. The architecture uses one desktop application, one local database, and avoids sync or background services in the MVP.

### Post-Design Gate Review

- **Desktop-First Experience**: PASS. The designed project structure separates desktop shell concerns, domain flows, and local command handling cleanly.
- **Local Data Safety**: PASS. Data model and command contracts keep writes behind explicit commands and lifecycle-controlled migrations.
- **Stable Offline Behavior**: PASS. Contracts and quickstart keep all critical flows local and testable without online services.
- **Basic Quality Gates**: PASS. Research and quickstart document both automated and manual verification paths.
- **Keep It Simple**: PASS. Design remains a single Tauri app with a feature-organized React frontend and a focused Rust backend.

**Structure Decision**: Tauri v2 monorepo layout within the `apps/desktop` workspace. Rust in `src-tauri/`, React in `src/`. No separate `backend/frontend` split — Tauri's convention co-locates both.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations or exception justifications are required for this plan.

## Key Design Decisions

### Cards are immutable copies at creation time

Cards store a snapshot of the dictionary entry. After creation, the card is independent — no foreign key to `entries`. This satisfies II (Local Data Safety) but means cards never auto-update if a dictionary is re-imported with corrections. Acceptable for MVP per spec assumptions.

### `MemoryRouter` over `BrowserRouter`

Tauri serves frontend assets from a custom `tauri://` protocol. History-based routing (`window.location.pathname`) works but requires additional `tauri.conf.json` configuration. `MemoryRouter` works identically across all Tauri versions without configuration.

### Zustand as cache, Rust as source of truth

All mutations: invoke Rust command first → update Zustand state only on success. On cold start: `store.loadCards()` populates the cache from SQLite. This means brief loading states on startup but eliminates any risk of Zustand state diverging from the database.
